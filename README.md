## Instructions

### How submission works (GitHub Classroom)

In GitHub Classroom **there is no separate "Submit" button**. You submit by **pushing your work to your assignment repository before the deadline**.

1. **Accept** the assignment (if you haven’t already) to get your own repository.
2. **Do your work** in that repository (clone, edit, commit locally).
3. **Push** your commits to GitHub before the deadline. **That push is your submission**—whatever is in the repository at the deadline is what will be graded.

You can push multiple times; only the latest state of the repo at the deadline counts. If your teacher set a hard cutoff, you will lose write access after the deadline, so push in time.

### Step 1: Read the Guide

Read the complete "Building with Cursor" guide. Focus on:
- Multi-file reasoning
- Good prompting techniques
- Debugging workflow
- Iteration loops

### Step 2: Add your reflection in the repository

Put your answers in the assignment repository so they are part of what you push. You can:

- Add a markdown file (e.g. `REFLECTION.md` or `assignment-1-reflection.md`) in the repo root with your answers, or
- Add a clear section in `README.md` with your answers.

Use clear headings for each question so grading is easy. Be specific and provide examples where requested.

### Step 3: Answer the questions

Answer the following questions in your chosen file (e.g. REFLECTION.md or README):

#### Question 1: Multi-file reasoning

**What is Cursor's multi-file reasoning and why is it useful?**

Provide a clear explanation of what multi-file reasoning means in the context of Cursor AI, and explain why this capability is valuable when building software.

#### Question 2: Good task prompts

**How would you phrase a "good task prompt" in Cursor? Give 1–2 examples.**

Provide 1-2 examples of well-phrased prompts you would use with Cursor AI. Explain what makes these prompts effective.

#### Question 3: Debugging workflow

**What is your workflow when debugging an error with Cursor?**

Describe your step-by-step process for debugging errors when using Cursor AI. Include how you would use Cursor to help identify and fix issues.

#### Question 4: Iteration and improvement

**How do you use iteration in Cursor to improve your code? Provide an example.**

Explain what iteration means in the context of AI-assisted coding with Cursor. Describe a scenario where you would use iterative prompting to improve code quality, and provide an example of how you would refine your prompts.

#### Question 5: Personal benefits

**What is the biggest benefit of AI-assisted coding for you personally?**

Reflect on how AI-assisted coding (using tools like Cursor) benefits your learning and development process. Be specific about what you find most valuable.

### Step 4: Submit by pushing

Your submission is whatever is in your assignment repository on GitHub at the deadline. When your reflection is ready:

1. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete Assignment 1: Cursor Fundamentals Reflection"
   git push
   ```
2. **That push is your submission.** There is no separate submit button. Push before the deadline.

## Acceptance Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- [ ] All 5 questions are answered
- [ ] Answers demonstrate understanding of concepts
- [ ] Examples are provided where requested
- [ ] Answers are clear and well-written
- [ ] Reflection is in the repository (e.g. REFLECTION.md or README section) with clear headings
- [ ] Changes are committed and **pushed to your assignment repository before the deadline** (that push is your submission)

## Submission Requirements (GitHub Classroom)

1. **Where:** Your reflection in the assignment repository (e.g. `REFLECTION.md` or a section in `README.md`), with clear headings for each question.
2. **Content:** Complete answers to all 5 questions.
3. **Submit:** Commit and **push** to your assignment repository before the deadline. In GitHub Classroom, **pushing is submitting**—there is no separate submit button.
